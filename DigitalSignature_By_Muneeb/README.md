# Digital-Signature

The C++ Implementation of my Digital Signature Algorithm 

Features:
1. Encryption/Decryption: RSA Algorithm
2. Hashing Scheme: MD5 Digest


Description of the files included:
 1. DATA FILE    : "inputfile.txt" : The file that is to be digitally signed (it contains the original data).
 2. APPEND FILE  : "hash.txt" : The 'encrypted' hash stays in this file. This is appended to the DATA FILE.
 
(P.S No external cryptographic Libraries used)
